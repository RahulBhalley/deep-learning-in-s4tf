# Swift for TensorFlow Examples
#### Get started with Swift for TensorFlow by examples

I have written a couple of things like neural networks, visualizations, etc. in [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) and I am writing more of these just for fun!

### Neural Networks
- [Wasserstein GAN](https://github.com/rahulbhalley/swift-for-tensorflow-examples/tree/master/NeuralNetworks/WassersteinGAN)

### Matplotlib
- [Oscillations](https://github.com/rahulbhalley/swift-for-tensorflow-examples/blob/master/Visualization/Oscillations.swift)
